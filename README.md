# 3DCNN_protein_structures

This repository shares model files from a 3D CNN neural network (see models/) trained on PDB structures obtained from Molecular Dynamics simulations data.

Code to train a 3D CNN on protein structures. Code to process PDB files into arrays containing coordinates is included.

One of the models (in model.py) is the 3D CNN architecture from Torng et al. 2017. This is a PyTorch implementation of their model.
